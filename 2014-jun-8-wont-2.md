The theatrics I'd suggested were more than effective. Besides showing something had happened in a very public way, it apparently caused our pursuers to stop chasing us. Or maybe to employ better cloaking techniques, be so stealthy Mordam couldn't see or feel them, and just continue to come after us never catching up, even as *we* were taking our sweet time… but I don't think so. Occam's razor and all that.

The fireworks are a nice addition to the night sky, too.

We're now walking eastward, long shadows in front, the glow of the city firmly behind us. The nearest border is nearly two hundred kilometres to the south-east, but we have to both avoid the main road, which is patrolled, the towns on that road, and the villages to some distance either side.

Well, given these constraints, we could have just gone southward, too, but crossing a desert isn't great when there's little possibility of restocking beforehand. At least in woodlands there's always food to be foraged or hunted, even while the risk of being found by a hunting party or other inconveniences is higher. Additionally, the hunting party who would come upon us will probably not have been alerted, or not have even heard, about us.

We haven't reached the start of the woods, yet, we're still in the grasslands, and will keep to the grasslands for another day or so, even when we could get within the vegetation. It's just faster. Crossing a field takes a few minutes, including the fence-jumping. I take to counting the number we pass through, fourteen right now, here's a fence, foot on the wood, launch myself in the air, feel my bag becoming weightless, throw my mass forward, over the fence, leg up, the weight crashing down again, foot in the ground, keep on walking. Fifteen.

Mordam does the same, we look choreographed. Five metres apart, not a word exchanged since we left. Travelling with Mordam can be a bit lonely.

Sixteen.

When you read fiction or listen to stories you start to think that running away really means *running*. You picture someone running full-pelt in the streets, the roads, the wild. And you think, because you're this person reading or listening to the stories of idealised people, you think "what a coward, running away" or "this one can run fast" or "go, save yourself!"

And yea, running away is about *running*, about being fast, sometimes. But mostly it's about slinking away discreetly, or just staying in place until things get less worse, or some combination. Sometimes you're covered in the blood of enemies and allies, so much you can't tell which is which, whether it be real or metaphorical. Often you're just walking away, leaving justice undone, leaving business unfinished, leaving colleagues behind. People run away in fancy vehicles, on foot, in a puff of smoke, or even with a knife to the wrist.

We're running away now by walking purposefully across fields — twenty-six — and climbing over wooden fences. It's not glamorous, it's not cowardly, it's not fast, I don't have the blood of anyone on my hands or myself, metaphorical or not. We were kicked out fairly (I mean, business is business, especially in the rare-and-illegal goods markets), we're leaving somewhat richer than when we came in (as was expected), we're leaving colleagues behind (which means less competition), and I have no intention of ever wilfully bringing a sharp blade anywhere near a vital body part.

After all, we have business to attend to.

Our destination is Tahl, a twin city at the border of this land and the next. It's a typical city state, controlled entry, controlled exit, one foot in each territory and more open black markets than you can fit in your mind. I've been there twice already, once without Mordam. I've made friends and rivals on both occasions. People go there to buy and sell, but for smugglers it's mostly a rest stop; as with most twin cities, there is a forty day quarantine duration for all people passing through: get in one day, get out a month and a third later on the other side.

I wonder if Katie is still there.

Fifty-two.
