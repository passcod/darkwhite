You know how sometimes, you see an object, a place, or someone says something, and whatever it is, it reminds you of a memory, of an instant in your life? And if you look at the memory, you can recall some amount of things, you know what came before, what happened after, the reasons, the people, the name of where you were. And if you reminisce about the past, you can remember things you did a lot, people you liked, loved, hated, were friends with, knew, crossed path with, heard of. You might not be able to recall every word of every conversation, every step you took on every beach, every shell you picked up and peered at, but you can remember that you had a conversation, that you walked on a beach, that you picked up shells. You can remember doing silly things with childhood friends, you can remember that you loved someone, and you can remember that someone.

I can't.

I have a few memories, instants burned into my mind. Things I regret, things I don't. I'm trying to fix that, spending time meditating and retracing my steps back into my own memories. But that's when I have free time.

And right now, I need to move fast.

Mordam is running back, so either that means he's *very* hungry, or something is wrong. I watch him for a few seconds, judge his speed, estimate the time I have to pack things up. Two minutes, no more. Make it 90 seconds, to be safe.

First is the bags: open them, fill them up. Don't bother to figure out what goes where, just mind to even out the weight and volume between them. Heavy items first, light ones last. About 68 seconds left.

Second is the weapons: a quick look outside reveals no obvious enemies, so either long range marksmen (but why would they wait?), siege weapons (a bit overkill, that), or artists. Artists are fairly unpredictable, so it doesn't hurt to prepare. *Shalt*, a mixture of salt and dead men's ashes, doesn't do much against anyone strong or clever enough, but if that's what I'm up against, I'm damned whatever I do. I sprinkle it around, ready Mordam's second staff, get out an extra power source, and 11 seconds to go.

Third is the fire. Get a pouch of sand or dirt to the ready, as well as green leaves if available… no time. Dirt then. I'm nearly ready, 4 seconds past the time.

Fourth is look out.

Mordam jumps the last three metres, and uses a rock outcropping to turn and get behind the cavern wall. I watch him carefully, look at his eyes, see how they dart around, taking in the entire scene. Even before he slams into the rock wall, he knows we're ready to leave, he knows where weaponry is, he knows what defences are up (just the one, besides those he might have set up prior).

- "What have you seen?", he asks.
- "Nothing."

The old man looks at me a moment. Old, but relatively unweathered. He has just run a few kilometres and is visibly tired. An outside observer might have given him forty years, or forty-five, no more, and indeed, as we visited towns and met people, many did. Those who got to know him a bit more upped that estimate by five to twenty years. Mordam doesn't often speak of ages past, but from his stories and what I've gleaned from comparing the tools and techniques he uses to written and unwritten records, I have estimated an age of at least three hundred years.

It's *old*, yes, but not uniquely so. When we pass through large cities, I often ask around for the oldest living person, or hearsay about that. There's a lot of tall tales going around, but they tend to repeat. However, some Universities, for example, have century-old professors; a writer in Ahn-Pier claims to be 532 years old, probably 533 now as it's been a while since we visited; and the Silver Keep's doyen is mentioned in the histories as being one of the oldest living artisans, going back at least a millennium. Now *that's* old.

- "There's three of them, they're poorly cloaked. I'm surprised you didn't notice."
- "Three? Why were you running back?"
- "Need to let the lord think they chased us away."
- "Did we get banned from a city again?"
- "Entire district, this time. I guess they heard about Wesnin."
- "And Tol. And maybe even Pellrie. We haven't been very discreet these past few months. And now we're banned from a district."
- "We were leaving anyway. And it's not like a ban will stop us from coming back, really."
- "Oh, I know, but given we're leaving, you could have let us move to a better camp. The nearest border is fifty kilometres *that way*!" I point in the direction of the city.

Mordam shrugs.

- "Well we won't go to the nearest, then, will we?"
- I grunted. "How long do we have before these three… what are they, artists? constructs? mercenaries? spirits?"
- "Just plain old regular practitioners. I've placed a loop trap, if they noticed it they shouldn't be able to break out of it within ten minutes, and if they haven't it will get deactivated when the power source—" he taps a pocket "— goes too far. Five hundred metres."
- "So just walk, then."
- "Five hundred metres isn't much, we've got a few extra minutes to repack things nicely."
- "I'd rather you carve up a surprise here. Theatrics, don't hurt them, make the lord think it's been dealt with."
- "Well then you repack. Don't think I haven't noticed *my* bag's the heaviest one." he jokes. At least I think he jokes. He hasn't lifted his bag yet, but who knows what tricks he has in his back pockets.

The other thing Mordam doesn't talk about much is exactly how powerful he really is. He was running away from three "plain old regular practitioners" and he had the time, dexterity, and concentration necessary to create a loop trap, something that requires terrain smoothing, perfect illusion, mind hacking, maybe even some low-distance, passive, unnoticeable transplacing. Yes, there's the possibility he just had a ready made scroll in his back pocket, but I'm not sure if that's any less impressive. Generic scrolls are extremely hard to make, what with all the variables that need to be taken into account.

He insists he just has a few tricks, ideas borrowed from others, and he just tinkers away. That's not enough, though. So my guess is that he's actually powerful. *Really* powerful.

The question, then, is *what in all ten hells is Mordam doing?!* Why with me, who has no ability and abysmal memory? Why not defeat pursuers instead of trapping them? Why run from lords and get banned from districts? Why sleep outside, or in cheap inns?

I have no idea.

***

The theatrics I'd suggested were more than effective. Besides showing something had happened in a very public way, it apparently caused our pursuers to stop chasing us.
