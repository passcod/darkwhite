title: Dark White 1-4

It had taken most of the night, but hours after midnight mom finally made me go to bed. "You need sleep more than answers right now." she said, and added "That is not negotiable." when I opened my mouth in protest. So I resolved to protest in silence, dumping all I've learned here to ellude sleep until I can no longer hold it off.

Once upon a time was a witch named Fahin Morrigan. No one knows where she came from, how she got her name, or what deal she made with the devil to get such maddeningly powerful magic. We learn that in school. Okay, maybe not that last part, because people tend to rever her and they would never ever insinuate she had made a pact with any dark god, spirit, or other such entity. So people just say "hey she was powerful and nobody knows why can we just leave it at that" and then go off and do exactly that.

After a few years lobbing fireballs at bandits and juggling with spiky steel balls infused with magic, or the inverse, the records aren't clear, she fell in love with some random nobody noone had ever heard off, disappeared from the world, had kids, and honed her craft in peace and quiet and away from every curious paparazzi out there. Still normal school stuff.

Finally, after two decades or so, she reappeared under the name Aléh. Aléh never did say she was Fahin, but she had the same build and looks, albeit older, as well as magic that was orders of magnitude above everyone else's. She went straight to the local Magic Academy, taught a class so advanced only the brightest of the bright managed to follow, and then moved on to other Schools and Institutes. After about another decade, the entire known magical had made this huge leap forward but was still centuries behind Aléh. So she wrote a bunch of books, gave them to scholars and wizards to study, and then traveled north to explore and was never seen again. End of school history, now comes the family story.

Fahin had two sons. Their names have been lost, as with most of the Line until about three centuries ago, but we'll come to that. The first one died at the age of fifteen, trying to make a girl fall in love with him. Instead of using conventional romance and flowers, he decided it would be faster and better to *make* her fall in love, despite the rules of wizards at the time forbidding such manipulations. I kinda facepalmed when I heard that, but mom reminded me that they didn't have the knowledge we do, then, so the rules were based on trial and error and whatever-great-wise-wizards-said. We know know, the reason for that interdict is not only ethical, it's because mind manipulation has to be done extremely carefully both because of the risk for failure and the large amount of energy required. So, the first son of Fahin half-killed himself by letting his energy drain into his love spell, and then the girl he had been casting it on killed him and almost her entire village out of madness and uncontrollable hate before being put down.

The second son, quite shaken, swore never to use magic. He broke that promise when his second progeny was stilborn, and consumed himself trying in vain to revive it. It is unknown whether this was a boy or a girl, and mom looked at me sternly as I asked, as if to say "why do it matter?". So there was now only one remaining in the Morrigan Line, two generations down. I have to say, it may have been the dark ages but these two's actions seem incredibly stupid to me. Trying to rewire brains and revive the dead without actually considering the problem first? Retards.

So, the girl grew up, got married, pretty normal life? Not many records. The only thing that's sure is that two decades later she turns out at the gates of some castle, begging for a magician to come out and help her husband, but the poor guy's already dead, causes unknown although I strongly suspect she offed him somehow. She's got three kids, they're all welcomed into the castle's village out of pity, she dies of grief and disease. Two of her kids are non-magical and trudge in the muck, the third is trained by the castle's magicians and becomes renowned and powerful. At the age of fifteen, he rebels against his masters and teachers and tries to free the non-magical and lesser magicians serfs from the overbearing grasp of the lords of the place. He does manage it, but the lords' allies march in, or try to. He accidentally kills himself trying to stop them. His sacrifice ends up inspiring the people who hold the castle for just over a hundred years before succombing. His two siblings migrate away after just a few years, in search of better places to live.

Meanwhile, historians and bards and wizards and various other people get together somehow to discuss the Morrigans. After three or four generations, the trend is clear: descendents of Fahin Morrigan are consistently more powerful than the rest of the general magical population, and they also tend to die early and with heavy consequences. Something has to be done. A group of people is assembled, its purpose defined, its meetings set, its discussions minutes, and its decisions carried out. Thus was formed the Morrigan Circle, an organisation dedicated to protecting the Morrigan Line, whatever the means, either with the knowledge of the affected or without. At least that's how it was presented to me. It seems obvious that such an organisation will have ulterior motives, but it also seems prudent not to voice these concerns. The Circle might be dedicated to protecting the Line, but they might just decide to protect it from itself if they perceive the need to.

Terri is from the Circle, here to protect me and, now, at mom's request, teach me. When I failed to pass the national magical test three years ago, mom and the Circle had thought the magic had skipped a generation again. Terri was sent here under pretense of friendship, and maybe a little more, because the Circle had been alerted of a threat; Terri says he does not know the details. I suspect he lies.

Terri began to suspect I do in fact have magic two months ago, and has been observing more closely ever since. That incident with the carpet is the reason he decided to voice his suspicions. Apparently even normal people with untaught magics shouldn't have done this much; the fact that I literally exude power merely by examining a magical object is apparently worrying.

To me, what's more worrying is that this hasn't happened earlier, and I have already manipulated carpets. Which can mean one of two things: either something triggered my sudden explosion in magical ability, and it would pay to finding that trigger, or, more likely, given Terri's suspicions, my abilities are growing. Given the timeline, I would add that they are growing *exponentially*.

Terri is right: I absolutely need to be taught.
