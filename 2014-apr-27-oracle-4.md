The sound of a laughing lawyer is not usually something anyone would appreciate. Eloïse simply cracked a small smile, which shut him up.

"No, seriously, I want to sign that contract and abide by it."  
"You're Na'k. If you sign, that would be in blood, and we'd have to make sure nobody can use a loophole to get at you."  
"Which would be why I'm talking to you. Incidentally, is there anything I can do to make the blood look like ink?"  
"When's the deadline?"  
"Three days."  
"I'll tell you in two. And you don't have to draw the blood straight from a wound, so you can mix in black ink."  
"Right. What's the minimum concentration of blood?"  
"One to nine would be enough."  
"Thank you."  she said curtly, dismissing him.

She watched the lawyer walk away. There was something satisfying to order people around, something she relished in her daily interactions. It wasn't all that common, which was a bit surprising considering her position. Her father would certainly do so several times an hour, and so would her mother, as well as many other members of her entourage, even including most of her siblings. 

_Why don't I feel this more often?_ she wondered. _Is it because I don't order people around as much, or is it because I don't do it consciously, or because of something else…?_

She thought back to this past week. When playing around with that boy on Monday, Maria had done most of the hurting and ordering around. When she walked to and from class, home, shops, and various other places, whether Maria accompanied her or not, people moved out of her way and were generally reverential all the time. She had no opportunity at any of these times to order people around; in fact, people ordered *themselves* around before she had even the time to open her mouth.

On the other hand, when she became Jerica, she had no or little control over anything. Sure, she could push people around, and for some reason they didn't complain — _I'll have to investigate this sometime_ — but *telling* anyone to do anything would simply result in blank or confused stares, or in her words being ignored completely. At least that was her experience so far, and she didn't want to try again: it really didn't feel nice.

There was something missing. Somehow she had lost the ability, or maybe she didn't ever have it in the first place, to successfully order people around. Why? 

_Let's think about this logically_, she thought. Actually, thinking felt less tangible right now, and she was alone, in her quarters, where nobody could hear her — probably. So she spoke up:

- "Let's talk about this logically."
- "I have power. This is evident. I have so much power that people do what I want them to before I even want them to." 
- "At the same time, I don't have power. People do things not on my say so, but of their own accord."
- "Why?"
- "Because they're afraid."
- "So I don't have *power*, I'm simply *frightening*."
- "That's annoying, because darkness is frightening, spiders can be frightening, death can be frightening, someone's kid sister playing a prank on someone can be frightening. Frightening isn't power. Power can be frightening, but that's not what I've got here."
- "I want power. I want to be able to order people around."
- "Why?"
- "Because it feels good."
- "How?"
- "I don't know."
- "What about when we're Jerica?"
- "That's different. My Jerica alternate doesn't want to order people around."
- "Why not?"
- "Because that's not in the character."
- "But the character is whatever you want it to be."
- "Yeah."
- "So it means that you *want* to order people around, but you also *don't* want to order people around. It's inconsistent!"
-  "Okay, no. I want to *feel good*. I feel good when ordering people around as Eloïse, but not as Jerica. It's not inconsistent, it just means I have different ways of feeling good in different situations."
- "Is that true or is it just rationalisation?"
- "I don't know. Maybe it's rationalisation. Maybe it's not. But it's how I feel. And I think that's what's important."
- "Okay, so… should we go to class as Jerica or as Eloïse today? Do we want to attempt to order people around, or do we want to do things differently?"
- "We'll probably fail if we just *attempt*—"
- "But how can we know?"
- "I just… I don't feel like it. Strangely, being Jerica is easier."
- "Liberating."
- "Yeah."
- "There's no expectations. Or very little anyway."
- "People don't look so frightened around me."
- "And that's disturbing? That people look frightened around us?"
- "Yeah. Yeah, it is. I want power. I don't want solely to be feared. Maybe being feared will come *with* the being powerful thing, but right now it's just that I'm feared. There's no power behind it."
- "Being Jerica means it's a blank slate."
- "Jerica *is* a blank slate, as far as everyone is concerned."
- "Even *we* don't know how she'll turn out."
