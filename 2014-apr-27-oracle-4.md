The sound of a laughing lawyer is not usually something anyone would appreciate. Elo√Øse simply cracked a small smile, which shut him up.

"No, seriously, I want to sign that contract and abide by it."  
"You're Na'k. If you sign, that would be in blood, and we'd have to make sure nobody can use a loophole to get at you."  
"Which would be why I'm talking to you. Incidentally, is there anything I can do to make the blood look like ink?"  
"When's the deadline?"  
"Three days."  
"I'll tell you in two. And you don't have to draw the blood straight from a wound, so you can mix in black ink."  
"Right. What's the minimum concentration of blood?"  
"One to nine would be enough."  
"Thank you."  she said curtly, dismissing him.
