__Darkwhite__ is an upcoming science-fantasy serial novel [I](https://passcod.name) am writing. Its first issue will be published on this site on the first Sunday of 2014, or whenever I achieve four issues of buffer, whichever occurs first.

Issues are currently looking to be about 1-3k words long, which, if you're not familiar with the medium, is *short*. They will be published every second Sunday, on the first second of that day according to UTC. I will endeavour to keep a large enough buffer at all times that unforseen circumstances will not stop the publishing, and forseen hiatii will be announced at least one issue before the last.

The adventurous and curious may find the drafts for upcoming chapters in a public place; I will not go to much effort to hide them from view; I will not advertise their location either. If you want spoilers for yourself, that's your choice.

See you soon!
