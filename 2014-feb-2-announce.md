title: Announce & Reboot
---

*Ahem*. After a false start due to ferocious holidaying
and rampant (ongoing) platform improvements, this serial
will (really, this time) be published on the __third Sunday
of March__ and __every second Sunday__ after that.

While the contents and website will remain more or less the
same, the title and URL will be changed sometime soon to
something that reflects the novel a bit better. This domain
will then redirect to the new one until __May 4__ where it
will be reclaimed for other purposes.

Issues are currently looking to be about 1-3k words long,
which, if you're not familiar with the medium, is *short*
(2-7 "print novel" pages approximately). 

This is a science-fantasy serial: while the fictional world
is definitely not ours, and its physics may behave oddly,
__the science is similar__ and should be credible. Note
however that I have little advanced physics knowledge (I read
*New Scientist*s, the occasional *Nature*, and talk regularly
with graduates) so if something seems *wrong* to you, do not
just chalk it up to fantasy-ness and tell me about it.
I'd love to learn more.

While it is not implemented yet, it is probable that an
__inline edit suggestion system__ will be available when
issues are published. With it, readers (that's you!) will
be able to suggest fixes to typos and other mistakes, which
should avoid embarassingly long "Typo threads" in comments,
leaving the floor open for more meaningful discussion.

The adventurous and curious may find the drafts for upcoming
issues in a public place; I will not go to much effort to hide
them from view; I will not advertise their location either. If
you want spoilers for yourself, that's your choice.

See you soon!
