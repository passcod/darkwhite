"In your first year, and in earlier education, you may have learned of the common base most modern Art is based on, commonly referred to as CL. You may further have been taught of the efforts of a group of people millenia ago who made Art safer by creating the LLVM framework. If you haven't, you probably slept through the entire year, or didn't come to class, in which case I'm not quite sure what you're doing here. A bed is surely more comfortable."

"We will not be touching either LLVM or CL in this class. We will be dealing with one of the more ancient forms of Art, Zhaed. That's Z-H-A-E-D if you're taking notes, which you should. As is outlined in the first few pages of the handout, this class is particular on syntax, and yes that also means spelling and grammar of the common tongues; mistakes will not be tolerated, and indeed could be harmful."

"Zhaed is a symbol-based form of Art. This might surprise you as the general public image of Zhaed and related Ancient Arts are of a sort of gibberish prose which uses an alphabet similar to that of the common tongues: this is a common misconception. Zhaed precedes the oldest of the common tongues by at least a millenia, the resemblance occurs because the dominant language from which ours are derived was itself derived from the Zhaed symbol set. This is especially dangerous to newcomers like you, but also to more experienced practitioners, as one may lapse into using Zhaed symbols to form words and sentences as if it was one of the common tongues, and doing so *will not work*, at best."

"For this reason, this class is theoretical. Only the very best of you will be able to attempt actual Zhaed Art in carefully controlled conditions, and none of you will be able to do so within the first four months of this class. Before we start, it is imperative that you sign and pass forward a copy of the contract located on page 14 through 19 of your handout. Not right now! I'll give you time to read through after I'm done explaining. The part we're interested in right now are clauses 3.7 and 5.2. The former binds you so that if you attempt to use the knowledge taught in this class without express written and witnessed permission, sanctions will be applied. The latter outlines these sanctions: they range from being suspended from the class to being tried — yes, by a *real* Court — and possibly incarcerated. So far nobody has breached this contract. I expect this to remain so."

"I'll give you the rest of the hour to carefully read through the contract, as well as the rest of this course introduction. You may ask questions during this time, and you can come down to my desk to speak more privately if you wish. Once you have returned your signed contract, you may leave. If you do not wish to sign, you may leave. If you need more time, perhaps to seek professional counsel, come see me so I know what your status is. Unless you do so, I will assume that you are out of this class if you do not return a signed contract before leaving. And unless you sign, you will not be able to take this class; therefore you will not be returning."

Eloïse chose this moment to wake up from her half-sleep. She stretched, yawn quietly, and slouched back in her chair. Nobody noticed her. _This is weird_, she thought. Experimentally, she got up. Nobody even blinked. _Whoa._ She even had to push her way through people to get to the Professor's desk. _Okay, what? I just shoved you aside, nerd, and you're not even…_

"Next, please" said Pr Pidof, snapping her out of her thoughts. "Now, miss…"  
"…" _Err. What— Oh. He doesn't know my name._ "Jerica Kraisteff. A-I, two Fs."  
"C or K?"  
"K. My family lawyer—"  
"Right. You have until the next lecture."  
"Thank you."

So *that* was how normal people interacted. _This is thoroughly weird._

She joined the flow of people pressing together at the exits and slowly making their way outside. Eloïse would have just transplaced out, Jerica had neither the extra reserves that made level four spells cheap nor the clearance to freely transplace within university grounds, nor of course the need: the next class was just next door, transplacing would have been a way to keep away from the crowded corridor for just five minutes, which seems quite ridiculous when you think about it.

The hallway outside had shifted into a large enough space to accommodate the surplus of people entering it. _Smart building. Huh. It was in the brochure, but I'd never actually noticed it._ She stepped towards a wall, sat against it, and a soft, deep purple seat rose out of the ground to provide support.

"I wouldn't." said a voice above and to the right.

A boy was standing, lightly pressed against the wall. He had auburn hair longer that any other person in the room, was taller than half of them, and paler than a third. Eloïse/Jerica tilted her head in askance. He reiterated:

"I wouldn't sit there if I were you. This might look like a smart building, but it really is a smart _university_, everything's on the one same system."  
"So?"  
"So when it gets overloaded, such as when classes end, it tends to sacrifice the little things in order to free resources for the big stuff. There's safeguards in place, so it won't crush everyone in a room by reverting it to its original size, but it has no qualms against dropping seats." He paused, and added with a somewhat bitter smile: "Unless of course there's somebody important on it."

Jerica frowned:

"But there's a bunch of people sitting over there? Does it make a difference about the number of people or something?"  
"There's a colour system. Or, at least, a colour differentiation. The seats over there are black, white, grey… that indicates they're static, they won't move. The other colours have different meanings, but the documentation got lost or it's burried in the archives, and nobody really knows the difference between purple and, say," he gestured at the other side of the hall, "ugly bright green. There's theories, but none of them are really complete or completely valid."  
"So nobody summons seating from the smart building system in peak times and everybody seats on static ones, because we've lost the user manual? That's rather shitty."  
"Yeah."

Jerica stood, looked up at the boy, but noticed her class was starting.

"Oh, uh, gotta go, thanks!"
