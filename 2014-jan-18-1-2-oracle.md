A moan escaped Maria's lips. No one heard it. Still, she could not take any chances. She got up, washed, and dressed herself. Today was a class day, so black jeans and a steel blue shirt would do just fine. Eloïse wasn't back — she'd probably spent the night home or with a man who would either die, be paid off, have his memory erased come morning, or a combination of the three. It wouldn't do for a young lady of an Old House to be known to sleep around, or to have any kind of sex at all, really. The love life of the Heir of Na'k was public knowledge: non-existent, save for the grandiose or dirty stories the rumour-mill ground up continuously. Her sex life, on the other hand, was hidden. Well, really, her *official* sex life was public knowledge: she was a virgin, chaste, her first night to be gifted to whoever got her hand in marriage. Here, the rumours were actually closer to the truth than the rumours themselves surmised. In fact, Eloïse prided herself in completing the various acts that most stories (those which made it to her ears, anyway) claimed she did. Maria took care of censoring the more deviant ones, as well as ones she did not want to take part in, or be even partially responsible for. There was also that albino Labradors in sexy lingerie were *extremely* expensive.

Maria found her roommate sleeping at a desk in her morning lecture, left a piece of dwarf cake (an extremely nutritive food, used originally by dwarfs on long mining expeditions during the second century, and now used in faraminous quantities by no-longer-starving students worldwide) in front of her, and hurried to her own class. She arrived a few seconds late, narrowly avoided the jet of blue fire the professor aimed at her, and jumped into her seat, three rows down. This happened every second week or so, enough that nobody blinked. Not both eyes, anyway. Nobody in Professor Barrow's class ever blinked both eyes at the same time past their first week, as she deemed her students should always maintain an awareness of their environment and blinking somehow defeated this. Her students were expected to arrive on time, be able to blink one eye only, or be fireproof.

Never mind that Professor Barrow taught Ancient Literature.

"Good morning, Miss Tabula. Half a mark off the next test for lateness. Be careful lest you fail from this alone."

A few students giggled. Maria ignored them, pulled her tally of how many times she could afford to arrive late again before the next test, stroke one off, and took her books out. It would have been easy to retaliate against those who laughed, but hard to keep it up; if she went after every random idiot, she wouldn't have any time left for homework, and then really *would* fail. She focused on the professor, instead.

[insert description]. She began:

"In the first century, elfin researchers uncovered an ancient message hidden in the protection runes of an abandoned city's ruins. Written in verse, totalling a hundred and seventeen stanzas, in the ancient language Shȧ, it has defied consensus from thousands upon thousands of researchers and historians, who each have a different opinion and interpretation. Today we will be studying a translation of stanzas twenty-nine and ninety-five, and you will give me five pages on your own interpretation. During the coming weeks, we will explore the different schools of thought that have divided scholars of the Shȧ stanzas, briefly cover the history of the translation we will be using, and finish by a cursory look at facts and conjectures about the people who most probably authored the text. If you wish to continue with this text, one of my third year classes studies it in its original version; I ask however that you refrain from using that or other translations for this year's course. If you already have knowledge of the text or the language, please do unlearn it in the next half minute. While I wait, here is the title of the work in Shȧ script:"

A student in the lower rows raised a hand. Karl, Maria recalled. Average, but always thirsty for knowledge.

"Can you pronounce it?"

The professor paused an instant, considering the question, then answered:

"Yes."  
"Now please open your textbook page five hundred and six, and read the stanzas." she continued, addressing the class.
