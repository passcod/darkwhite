Maria found her roommate sleeping at a desk in her morning lecture, left a piece of dwarf cake (an extremely nutritive food, used originally by dwarfs on long mining expeditions during the second century, and now used in faraminous quantities by no-longer-starving students worldwide) in front of her, and hurried to her own class. She arrived a few seconds late, narrowly avoided the jet of blue fire the professor aimed at her, and jumped into her seat, three rows down. This happened every second week or so, enough that nobody blinked. Not both eyes, anyway. Nobody in Professor Barrow's class ever blinked both eyes at the same time past their first week, as she deemed her students should always maintain an awareness of their environment and blinking somehow defeated this. Her students were expected to arrive on time, be able to blink one eye only, or be fireproof.

Never mind that Professor Barrow taught Ancient Literature.

"Good morning, Miss Tabula. Half a mark off the next test for lateness. Be careful lest you fail from this alone."

A few students giggled. Maria ignored them, pulled her tally of how many times she could afford to arrive late again before the next test, stroke one off, and took her books out. It would have been easy to retaliate against those who laughed, but hard to keep it up; if she went after every random idiot, she wouldn't have any time left for homework, and then really *would* fail. She focused on the professor, instead.

She'd heard the professor was a dragon months before class began, but hadn't realised that dragons in real life weren't dragons as in fairy tales. It made sense in retrospect; nearly every creature depicted in human fairy tales are fake, but dragons were relatively rare, and apparently looked like dwarves at first glance; she'd made the mistake earlier in the year, when she'd assumed, like many other students, that the smallish humanoid stepping up onto the stage was a TA or something.

Not that dwarven or elvish fairy tales were much better. It seemed each had different wild tales about the other species that were just fantastical. Most people just laughed it off, and were occasionally embarassed when their expectations didn't match. A minority, which could be quite vocal about it, used such tales on both sides of the fence for xenophobic purposes. This was most frustrating when it was happening in situations of power, either political, judicial, or within enforcement, but the fear of public ridicule kept most of these at bay. The worst of it came out through diplomatic relations and… in children's playgrounds. Kids can and will be cruel if they see an opportunity. Maria knew that first-hand.

Professor Barrow was a dragon, which meant she was about two thirds of a human adult's size, had three fingers and a thumb at each hand, and could see at night, similarly to cats. She also had an affinity with fire magic, although whether that was proper to dragons or specific to her, Maria didn't know. She was knowledgeable, strict, and — according to older students — a very good teacher, especially if you weren't on her bad side.

She began:

"In the first century, elfin researchers uncovered an ancient message hidden in the protection runes of an abandoned city's ruins. Written in verse, totalling a hundred and seventeen stanzas, in the ancient language Shȧ, it has defied consensus from thousands upon thousands of researchers and historians, who each have a different opinion and interpretation. Today we will be studying a translation of stanzas twenty-nine and ninety-five, and you will give me five pages on your own interpretation. During the coming weeks, we will explore the different schools of thought that have divided scholars of the Shȧ stanzas, briefly cover the history of the translation we will be using, and finish by a cursory look at facts and conjectures about the people who most probably authored the text. If you wish to continue with this text, one of my third year classes studies it in its original version; I ask however that you refrain from using that or other translations for this year's course. If you already have knowledge of the text or the language, please do unlearn it in the next half-minute. While I wait, here is the title of the work in Shȧ script:"

A student in the lower rows raised a hand. Karl, Maria recalled. Average, but always thirsty for knowledge.

"Can you pronounce it?"

The professor paused an instant, considering the question, then answered:

"Yes."  
"Now please open your textbook page five hundred and six, and read the stanzas." she continued, addressing the class.

A man in black.  
A man in white.  
A man in every shade between.  
And still no man  
for this coloured lady.

Rain never bothered Maria. The family story went that she was born under the rain, but everyone had family stories, and few were actually real. Nevertheless, rain had never bothered Maria.

It would have been nearly effortless to shield oneself from the rain, and the rest of the world did so. In fact, the task was so common that cities had instaured automatic individual protection systems for everyday annoyances like this. Rain, hail, any other kind of weatherly precipitation, sun burn and strike, various common diseases and air- and water-borne microbes. Cities were cleaner, the individual model was more efficient than city-wide measures, and the privilege could be taken away. Not all cities were like that, but more and more these days. It was a bit worrisome to a lot of insignificant spellmakers who thrived on fixing the small stuff. Well, they still had paper cuts and bruised fingers to occupy themselves.
