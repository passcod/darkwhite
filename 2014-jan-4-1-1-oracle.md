The boy was screaming. Earlier, there had been cries, sobs and tears, but she had found it annoying and repetitive. The amount of pain necessary for one to stop sobbing and simply scream instead was a very thin threshold, hard to pin down once it was reached, as going back below wouldn't revert the behaviour quite immediately.

Maria reached down and flicked her finger, hitting the hilt of her obsidian knife. The boy's arms jerked in theire restraints, his scream pitching up in intensity for a brief moment before settling back to its regular level. He gasped and gagged, drawing in air raggedly and exhaling loudly, in and out, in and out, in an attempt to stop screaming. Maria looked at her watch. The heavy breathing continued. An eternity, in the form of barely two minutes, passed slowly by, while the rhythm of whistling sucking and blowing accelerated. Finally, just before the two minute mark, the screaming started again. She smiled and left the room.

Outside, two young women sat in opposite chairs.

One was pale, bunched up in her seat, softly trembling, her eyes empty. She had straight blonde hair, enough to reach the middle of her back. It waved and shifted in step with her shivers. Her face was streaked by tears, her eyes were red, but she was otherwise unharmed, physically at least. She was wearing an elegant dark grey shirt, with rich silver-thread embroidery, and a simple shirt that was wet where tears had stricken it. Maria looked at her for a moment, then turned her attention to the other woman.
