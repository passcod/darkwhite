title: 1-1 Oracle

The boy was screaming. Earlier, there had been cries, sobs and tears, but she had found it annoying and repetitive. The amount of pain necessary for one to stop wailing and simply scream instead was a very thin threshold, hard to pin down once it was reached, as going back below wouldn't revert the behaviour quite immediately.

Maria reached down and flicked her finger, hitting the hilt of her obsidian knife. The boy's arms jerked in their restraints, his shriek pitching up in intensity for a brief moment before settling back to its regular level. He gasped and gagged, drawing in air raggedly and exhaling loudly, in and out, in and out, in an attempt to stop crying out. Maria looked at her watch. The heavy breathing continued. An eternity, in the form of barely two minutes, passed slowly by, while the rhythm of whistling, sucking and blowing accelerated. Finally, just before the two minute mark, the screaming started again. She smiled and left the room.

Outside, two young women sat in opposite chairs.

One was pale, bunched up in her seat, softly trembling, her eyes empty. She had straight blonde hair, enough to reach the middle of her back. It waved and shifted in step with her shivers. Her face was streaked by tears, her eyes were red, but she was otherwise unharmed, physically at least. She was wearing an elegant dark grey shirt, with rich silver-thread embroidery, and a simple skirt that was wet where eye water had stricken it. Maria looked at her for a moment, then turned her attention to the other woman.

This one was sitting calmly, reading a looparchment of trash fiction one would typically find in transport stations' boutiques. Her hair was bright red, although if one was to watch carefully, one would be able to observe the colour changing ever so slowly. In an hour, it would be crimson; in five, it would be a shade of jade. Very few people knew what her original hair looked like, below the enchantment. Its length and shape also varied widely, making Eloïse Na'k hard to identify from a distance — although the wide berth most gave her was hard to miss in a crowd, or anywhere there was people, really. She was staring evenly at the young woman in front of her, smiling softly. Her face was perfectly symmetrical, not a blemish nor a fold anywhere. She wore the solid white tunic characteristic of the House of Na'k, but that was a special occasion (she hated the thing), and she would soon clad her usual clothing.

Smoothly, she stood.

"Let's go."

Maria held out her hand, and the screaming stopped as her two knives floated back to her grasp. A flick of the wrist sent blood splatting on the tiled floor. With one last glance to the prostrated woman still in her chair, she ordered:

"Go pick up your boyfriend. I don't want him dying in there and stinking up the place."

They were late. Or rather, *she* was late. Maria fretted around the room, her version of pacing back and forth a flurry of small adjustments to everything everywhere she could reach. She'd moved the shoe rack a few millimetres one way; evenly placed every shoe, boot, ballerina and slipper on its shelves, sorted them by category, frequency of use, and date of acquisition; alphabetised the entire book-wall, all five sides of it, first by author, then by title, then by date of publication, finally settling on one of the three intercounty standard, don't ask me which; verified the enchantment on every pen they owned (or had borrowed, stolen, made) and arranged them by various criteria I'm not going to mention; retouched a counterfeit of the famous 'Blue Wizzen' because "the counterfeiter didn't consider the original colour of the mid-seventh-century violet pigment".

But even the amateur desecration of a million-sol piece of falsified art didn't hurry Eloïse, who was still powdering her nose. It had been three minutes! At this rate, she would be an entire fifteen seconds late. That was unacceptable.

"Elo! Get the fuck out!" Maria bellowed.

The bathroom's door depolished window cracked. A flick of a finger repaired it. Eloïse threw it open, stepped out, and slammed it close. All the glass shattered and flew inwards. A flick of a finger repaired it. The Heir of the House of Na'k glanced darkly at Maria, smirked, threw her fist into the pane— and bruised her knuckles. A flick of a finger repaired them.

"Aïeee… Maria, what the fuck?!"  
"I hardened it. Put your shoes on, we're on a schedule."  
"*I*'m on a schedule. You're not invited to that stupid party !"  
"Nor am I invited to break your fingers repeatedly. But I *will* do so if you do not go. *Now*."  
"Why do you *care*?"

The question went unanswered. It never was. Maria had always taken care of Eloïse. She suspected that was on her family's orders. No one else, not even her siblings, nor the various suitors who had dared approach over the years, no one had ever demonstrated such unflinching loyalty. However, when she'd finally (it took a certain while, of internal deliberation and of getting an audience) voiced her suspicion to her father, he had laughed but offered no answer. When she'd done (after an even longer time) the same to Maria, *she* had laughed *harder*, and still no explanation was given. Eloïse was fairly frustrated about that.

She put her shoes on, slid her hands in her pockets (the threat still hung in the air like a deadly butterfly, and it made her fingers tingle), and walked out the door. A couple making out at the end of the corridor jumped, turned, and scrambled away in flight. A half sigh and a transplacing spell later, she had departed.
