"Elo?"  
"Yeah?"  
"Let's go back home."  

Elo looked at me. I was dripping with icy water, the plit plac of its drops on the pavement below, around my feet, an irregular song that would have been pleasing were it in a music cube and not a consequence of my previous failures. My hair, curiously enough, at least to an outside observer, was still dry. It was always dry. The wetness began on my scalp, my face, and most thouroughly my clothing. The woolen scarf I had thought would stave off the cold was, surprisingly, soaked through and through; it hung off my neck pathetically, weighing me down. I didn't even have the strength to pull it away.

Elo took this all in, grumbled I would regret it, grumbled *she* would regret it, got out a small seal, and ripped it. She blinked. I nearly crumbled from the drain, as the water was forcibly ejected from my clothes and skin and vaporised as soon as it was a little distance away. The feeling was awful, as if a million worms covered me for a brief moment and were suddenly pulled off. The effect was unremarkable, a simple cloud of steam enveloping me for a few seconds, which in the night was nothing but a bit more darkness as the stars and my surroundings were obscured.

Elo still looked a bit annoyed.

"You're going to have to go back tomorrow, and again until you get it right, you know?"  
"Sleep. Now. Please."  
"Fine. Come on, we've got a while to go."

When I'd first set foot on campus, a mere twenty months earlier, the permanent glowballs floating just a few metres above ground had seemed extravagant spending. Nowhere in the Outlands, nor in my occasional visit to the nearest Citadel, has I witnessed such unwarranted spending. Glowballs are expensive contraptions made of a complex spell that pulls energy from the surroundings. Not only do they provide permanent illumination as long as energy is nearby (which is always, except maybe in the darkest of outer space), they also absorbed radiation going *up*, *near*, or *through* them, making them quite efficient as well as leaving the sky free and clear and the stars bright at night. They were extremely cheap to *run* — free, in fact — but the initial investment was discouraging. The campus had millions, one every ten metres in a grid pattern all over the grounds, and in some of the buildings and basements as well. The cost would have been astronomical.

I'd asked once, and after going through a few people I found one who had actually bothered to look it up once "on a particularly boring day." Apparently, a grad student had thought *it would be pretty*, invented the glowballs, and spread them around as an experiment. Then he just sold them to people to pay for his apartment. It must be made of gold or something.

A week later, the abundance of glowballs was all but forgotten. One of my classes was taught by a dragon, and magic scrolls, seals, spells, runes, crystals, and various other contraptions were just *everywhere*. There were a few Outlandish first years and others not used to that kind of things who, like me, got surprised at first, but the vast majority of students, old and new, were utterly oblivious to the amount of *power* this place exhuded. Wards nonwithstanding, a skilled thief could easily retire if even a small heist was pulled off — which would never happen, there were *dragons* walking around. You do not mess with a dragon. A dragon had tried to singe my hair for talking in class. I'd been a bit shaky for *weeks* afterwards.
