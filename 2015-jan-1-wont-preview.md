You know how sometimes, you see an object, a place, or someone says something, and whatever it is, it reminds you of a memory, of an instant in your life? And if you look at the memory, you can recall some amount of things, you know what came before, what happened after, the reasons, the people, the name of where you were. And if you reminisce about the past, you can remember things you did a lot, people you liked, loved, hated, were friends with, knew, crossed path with, heard of. You might not be able to recall every word of every conversation, every step you took on every beach, every shell you picked up and peered at, but you can remember that you had a conversation, that you walked on a beach, that you picked up shells. You can remember doing silly things with childhood friends, you can remember that you loved someone, and you can remember that someone.

I can't.

I have a few memories, instants burned into my mind. Things I regret, things I don't. I'm trying to fix that, spending time meditating and retracing my steps back into my own memories. But that's when I have free time.

And right now, I need to move fast.

Mordam is running back, so either that means he's *very* hungry, or something is wrong. I watched him for a few seconds, judging his speed, estimating the time I have to pack things up. Two minutes, no more. Make it 90 seconds, to be safe.

First is the bags: open them, fill them up. Don't bother to figure out what goes where, just mind to even out the weight and volume between them. Heavy items first, light ones last. About 68 seconds left.

Second is the weapons: a quick look outside reveals no obvious enemies, so either long range marksmen (but why would they wait?), siege weapons (a bit overkill, that), or artists. Artists are fairly unpredictable, so it doesn't hurt to prepare. *Shalt*, a mixture of salt and dead men's ashes, doesn't do much against anyone strong or clever enough, but then again I wouldn't have much of a chance against any such artist. I sprinkle it around, ready Mordam's second staff, get out an extra power source, and 11 seconds to go.

Third is the fire. Get a pouch of sand or dirt to the ready, as well as green leaves if availableâ€¦ no time. Dirt then. I'm nearly ready, 4 seconds past the time.

Fourth is look out.

Mordam jumps the last three metres, and uses a rock outcropping to turn and get behind the cavern wall. I watch him carefully, look at his eyes, see how they dart around, taking in the entire scene. Even before he slams into the rock wall, he knows we're ready to leave, he knows where weaponry is, he knows what defences are up (just the one, besides those he might have set up prior).

- "What have you seen?", he asks.
- "Nothing."

The old man looks at me a moment. I say old, but he wasn't frail or seemed weak. He has just run a few kilometres and is visibly tired. An outside observer might have given him forty years, or forty-five, no more, and indeed, as we visited towns and met people, many did. Those who got to know him a bit more upped that estimate by five to twenty years. Mordam doesn't often speak of ages past, but from his stories and what I've gleaned from comparing the tools and techniques he uses to what books say or others reminisce, I have estimated an age of at least three hundred years.

It's *old*, yes, but not uniquely so. When we pass through large cities, I often ask around for the oldest living person, or hearsay about that. There's a lot of tall tales going around, but they tend to repeat. However, some Universities, for example, have century-old professors; a writer in Ahn-Pier claims to be 532 years old, probably 533 now as it's been a while since we visited; and the Silver Keep's doyen is mentioned in the histories as being one of the oldest living artisan, going back at least a millennium. Now *that's* old.

- "There's three of them, they're poorly cloaked. I'm surprised you didn't notice."
- "Three? Why were you running back?"
- "Need to let the lord think they chased us away."
- "Did we get banned from a city again?"
- "Entire district, this time. I guess they heard about Wesnin."
- "And Tol. And maybe even Pellrie. We haven't been very discreet these past few months. And now we're banned from a district."
- "We were leaving anyway. And it's not like a ban will stop us from coming back, really."
- "Oh, I know, but given we're leaving, you could have let us move to a better camp. The nearest border is fifty kilometres *that way*!" I pointed in the direction of the city.

Mordam shrugged.
